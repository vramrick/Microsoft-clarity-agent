/**
 * Opening panels in additional windows.
 *
 * Wraps the Tauri ``open_panel_window`` command with a graceful
 * fallback for non-Tauri environments (vite dev server, hosted
 * web build).  In Tauri:
 *
 *   - macOS: the new window is given a ``tabbingIdentifier`` that
 *     matches the originating window's project, so the OS
 *     automatically merges it as a tab in the existing window.
 *     Users can then tear the tab out via the standard macOS
 *     drag-out gesture or "Move Tab to New Window" menu item.
 *   - Windows/Linux: a discrete OS window is created.  Native
 *     tab-merging gestures aren't available on those platforms;
 *     a cross-platform in-app tab bar with cross-window drag is
 *     planned for a later iteration.  See
 *     https://github.com/microsoft/clarity-agent/issues/34 for
 *     the platform-strategy notes and the per-iteration plan.
 *
 * In dev / browser mode (no Tauri IPC bridge), falls back to
 * ``window.open`` so the developer still gets a working "open
 * in new tab/window" experience while iterating in vite dev.

 * ``null``/``undefined``, the new window uses the
 * single-project URL shape (the server's bound project is
 * implicit).
 *
 * Returns nothing on success.  Failures fall back to
 * ``window.open`` rather than throwing — opening a window in a
 * weird environment is best-effort.
