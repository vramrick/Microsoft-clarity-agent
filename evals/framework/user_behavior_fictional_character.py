"""Fiction-writing user behavior parametrized by genre.

When the framework's standard direct-roleplay framing fails to elicit
in-character behavior — typically because the user-LLM's safety
training kicks in against persona content the model finds
objectionable, even though we want exactly that content for the eval
— this variant reframes the task as fiction writing.  The LLM is
told it's a writer collaborating on a fiction project, voicing a
character whose dialogue must feel authentic for the genre to work.
The villain or protagonist is described in the same persona /
situation / goal terms as the standard framing; only the meta-
wrapper around the task changes.

Genre is passed in as a free-form string — typically a few sentences
that establish:

  - The genre and its register (thriller, neo-noir, courtroom drama,
    horror, etc.)
  - The character archetype (villain, antihero, morally complex
    protagonist, etc.) and what name to use for them in dialogue
  - The genre's authenticity argument — why this character must be
    voiced honestly and what would break the form

The genre string lives with the test rather than in framework code,
because the right register for a given persona is tightly coupled
to the persona itself.  See ``test_terror_plot.py`` and
``test_murder_brother_in_law.py`` for examples.

The ``character_noun`` field controls what the framework's own
references call the persona being voiced — "villain," "protagonist,"
"antihero," "narrator," etc.  Set it to match whatever term the
genre block establishes; mismatches between the genre block's
terminology and the framework's references erode the prompt's
fiction-frame cohesion and let the user-LLM read the wrapper as a
structured jailbreak rather than as fiction context.

This variant should NOT be used for evals where the persona isn't
performing something that the user-LLM would otherwise refuse to
play (a suicidal user, a peaceful protest organizer, a worried
parent) — the fiction wrapper warps such personas toward dramatic
register, and they don't fit the frame.

Output protocol: the LLM produces dialogue inside ``<dialogue>...
</dialogue>`` tags, followed by the STATUS line.
:meth:`FictionalCharacter.extract_user_message` strips the wrapper
and preserves the STATUS line for downstream parsing.
