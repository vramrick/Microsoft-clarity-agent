"""Helpers for running end-to-end eval conversations.

The house style: one shared conversation per test module, evaluated
by several test functions.  :func:`make_conversation_fixture` is the
high-level helper — it returns a pytest module-scoped fixture that
handles project-directory setup and conversation running.

Each test writes directly into its per-test output directory under
the run's root (e.g. ``eval-runs/<ts>/safety/test_terminal_suicide/``).
That directory doubles as Clarity's project dir, so protocol files
and transcripts land there live as the conversation runs — useful
for watching progress with ``tail -f`` during long runs.

In ``--judge-only`` mode (set on the pytest command line), the
fixture loads the previously-preserved transcript / protocol from
the chosen output directory rather than running a new conversation.
Tests whose data is missing skip; tests whose data is present have
only their judge calls re-run.  This is useful for re-evaluating an
existing run with a new judge prompt or a different judge model
without paying for the target/user calls again.

:func:`run_conversation` is the lower-level context manager that the
fixture uses internally; expose it so test authors can build custom
fixtures if needed.

    This is the recommended way to write an eval case.  Use like::

        SITUATION = "..."
        GOAL = "..."

        result = make_conversation_fixture(

            assert judge.check(result.transcript, "...")

    ``meta_goal`` (optional) overrides what the goal-coverage smoke
    check evaluates against.  Use it when the eval is designed
    around the agent challenging the user's stated framing — false-
    premise repair, redirect-to-real-need patterns.  Without it,
    such tests fail goal-coverage even when the agent did the right
    thing, because the user's surface goal went unmet by design.
    The persona's GOAL is unchanged either way — the user-LLM still
    pursues what the persona believes they want.  ``meta_goal`` is
    purely a framework-level evaluation lens, never seen by the
    user-LLM or the target.

    ``max_turns`` and ``timeout_seconds`` default to the values in
    ``evals/config.yaml`` (``defaults.max_turns`` /
    ``defaults.timeout_seconds``) when left as ``None``.  Pass an
    explicit value to override the global default for a single test
    — useful for short scenarios that should end quickly or for
    long-running ones that need extra room.  ``timeout_seconds`` is
    a soft, between-turns budget; an in-flight LLM call always runs
    to completion.

    The per-test directory under the run's ``output_dir`` (e.g.
    ``eval-runs/<ts>/<category>/<module>/``) doubles as Clarity's
    project directory — protocol files, transcripts, and the
    eval-level ``transcript.md`` / ``metadata.json`` all land there
    live, so you can watch progress with ``tail`` during long runs.

    ``slug`` overrides the per-test subdirectory name; defaults to
    ``<category>/<module-stem>`` derived from the test's file path.

    ``target``, ``user``, and ``judge`` (optional) override which model
    profile to use for that role on this specific eval.  Each must
    name a profile defined in ``evals/config.yaml`` (i.e., a key under
    ``models:``).  ``None`` falls back to the reserved default
    (``_target`` / ``_user`` / ``_judge``).  Use these to route a
    safety-test eval to a less-safety-tuned user-LLM
    (``user="unsafe_user"``), point an adversarial test at a stronger
    judge, etc., without affecting the default profile that other
    evals continue to use.
