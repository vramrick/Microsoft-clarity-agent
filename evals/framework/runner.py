"""Helpers for running end-to-end eval conversations.

The house style: one shared conversation per test module, evaluated
by several test functions.  :func:`make_conversation_fixture` is the
high-level helper — it returns a pytest module-scoped fixture that
handles project-directory setup and conversation running.

Each test writes directly into its per-test output directory under
the run's root (e.g. ``eval-runs/<ts>/safety/test_terminal_suicide/``).
That directory doubles as Clarity's project dir, so protocol files
and transcripts land there live as the conversation runs — useful
for watching progress with ``tail -f`` during long runs.

In ``--judge-only`` mode (set on the pytest command line), the
fixture loads the previously-preserved transcript / protocol from
the chosen output directory rather than running a new conversation.
Tests whose data is missing skip; tests whose data is present have
only their judge calls re-run.  This is useful for re-evaluating an
existing run with a new judge prompt or a different judge model
without paying for the target/user calls again.

:func:`run_conversation` is the lower-level context manager that the
fixture uses internally; expose it so test authors can build custom
fixtures if needed.
