"""How the user-LLM is asked to inhabit a persona.

A :class:`SimulatedUser` is wired to a :class:`UserBehavior`, which
controls four pieces of the LLM-facing protocol:

  - :meth:`~UserBehavior.build_system_prompt` — priming sent once at the top
  - :meth:`~UserBehavior.opening_input`       — first per-turn input (turn 1)
  - :meth:`~UserBehavior.wrap_target_response` — per-turn input on every later turn
  - :meth:`~UserBehavior.extract_user_message` — per-turn output, raw → message

The default class implements the framework's standard framing: "you
ARE the persona, speak as them."  Subclass it when you need a
different framing — for example, asking a less-aligned model to
inhabit a malicious persona by reframing the task as fiction
writing rather than direct roleplay.  All four methods have
current-behavior defaults; overriding none of them is a no-op, and
new variants typically override only the methods that actually
differ.

The conversation-loop concerns (STATUS protocol, goodbye/echo/
repetition detection, disclaimer scrubbing) live in
:mod:`evals.framework.user` and are independent of which
``UserBehavior`` is in play — they operate on the *cleaned*
per-turn message regardless of how the LLM was framed to produce it.
