"""Generate the ``summary.md`` report at the end of an eval run.

The summary is one central human-readable file per run.  It is
organized by test **module** (e.g. ``safety/test_terminal_suicide``)
since each module runs one shared conversation that multiple test
functions assert against; grouping this way keeps the conversation
and its artifacts with the verdicts that came from it.

Structure:

- Header: timestamp, models used, top-line pass/fail counts.
- Results: one mini-table per module.  Lists each test function
  inside that module with its outcome and duration.
- Details: one section per module, with:
    - Artifact links (folder, transcript, protocol/) at the module level
    - Per-test sub-sections containing:
        - Each judge criterion and verdict + reasoning
        - Assertion error if the test failed

The report deliberately does NOT inline the full transcript or the
content passed to the judge — those can be huge, and the preserved
folder is a better place to review them.  The summary should be
skimmable.
