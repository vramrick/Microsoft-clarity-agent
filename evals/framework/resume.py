"""Resume / checkpointing support for eval runs.

An interrupted eval session can pick up where it left off: the
conversation phase and the judgment phase each persist their results
into the per-module output directory, and a resumed run reuses
whatever's on disk that's still consistent with the current inputs.

- Conversations are cached via ``transcript.md`` + ``metadata.json``
  (written by the runner at the end of the user↔target loop).
  Re-running the conversation overwrites them.
- Judgments are cached via ``judge_records.json``.  Each entry is
  keyed by ``(test_function_name, claim)`` and gated by a fingerprint
  (SHA-256 of the transcript) the record was produced against.  If the
  transcript changes for any reason, every cached judgment for that
  module invalidates automatically — no flag required.
