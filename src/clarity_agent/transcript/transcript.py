"""
The :class:`Transcript` — one project's persistent conversation thread.

This is the public entry point for everything transcript-related.
Bind it to a project directory once and use the methods to enumerate
chapters, read events, write events, and rebuild conversation
context for the backend.

A *transcript* is the ordered set of *chapters* under
``<project>/.clarity-protocol/transcripts/``.  Each chapter is a
file pair:

* ``NNNN.events.jsonl`` — canonical structured event log (source of
  truth).  One JSON object per line, discriminated by ``type``.
* ``NNNN.md`` — human-readable rendering, written synchronously
  alongside the JSONL.

The current chapter is implicitly the highest-numbered one.  Older
chapters are read-only.  :meth:`start_new_chapter` rolls over to a
fresh chapter file; nothing is ever overwritten.

Construction is cheap — no I/O.  File handles only exist between
the first :meth:`write` (or :meth:`start_new_chapter`) call and the
matching :meth:`close`.  Use :class:`Transcript` as a context
manager for guaranteed cleanup::

    with Transcript(project_dir) as t:
        t.write(UserTurn(...))
        t.write(AssistantText(...))
        # ... t.close() runs on scope exit ...

Or hold it open across a long-running session (e.g., from
:class:`WebSessionAdapter`) and ``close()`` explicitly when the
session ends.

The rest of this module is internal: path conventions, JSONL
parsing, the per-chapter writer with its file handles + lock.  None
of it is exported from :mod:`clarity_agent.transcript` — callers
talk to :class:`Transcript`.
