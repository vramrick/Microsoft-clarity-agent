"""
Structured event schema for transcript JSONL files.

Each event represents one observable thing that happened in a
conversation: a user message arrived, the assistant emitted text or
called a tool, a tool returned a result, the user changed the model,
a new SDK session was started for an existing chapter, etc.

Events are stored as one-line JSON in the ``NNNN.events.jsonl`` file
alongside their human-readable rendering in ``NNNN.md``.  The JSONL
is canonical; the markdown is derived.

Schema versioning
-----------------
Every event carries a ``schema_version`` so future changes to the
event format remain readable.  Today there's only ``"1"``.  When we
need to add a field with a behavioral change, bump the version and
let the parser dispatch on it.

Discriminated union
-------------------
Pydantic's discriminator on the ``type`` field lets us load any event
from raw JSON into the right typed class without manual dispatch:

    >>> ev = parse_event({"type": "user_turn", "timestamp": "...",
    ...                   "content": "hello"})
    >>> isinstance(ev, UserTurn)
    True

Tool-use fidelity
-----------------
The Anthropic SDK / API delivers structured tool-use blocks with
``tool_use_id``, ``name``, and ``input`` (a JSON object).  We
preserve that structure verbatim in :class:`ToolUse` so a future
"replay this chapter via the API" path can reconstruct messages
faithfully.

:class:`ToolUseText` is a *legacy-only* fallback: events produced
during migration from old timestamp-named transcripts where only the
flattened ``[Tool] name -> detail`` string was available.  New writes
always use :class:`ToolUse`.
