"""
Internal: render structured events to human-readable markdown.

Used by :class:`Transcript`'s writer to produce the ``NNNN.md``
sidecar alongside each JSONL append.  Not part of the public API —
callers should reach :class:`Transcript` for any rendering they need
(currently exposed indirectly via ``Transcript.context_summary``).

Each event renders to a self-contained markdown fragment.
Renderings are deliberately *stateless* — the fragment for event N
doesn't depend on event N-1.  This keeps the writer simple and
means the markdown can be regenerated from JSONL with a pure
``"".join(render_event(e) for e in events)``.

Style notes
-----------
The format intentionally echoes the legacy pre-#35 transcripts
(``**User:**``, ``**Assistant:**``, ``    [Tool] name -> detail``) so
migrated chapters look familiar and existing user habits (grepping
for ``**User:**``, etc.) still work.  Tool inputs are rendered to a
short string via the same ``extract_tool_detail`` helper the legacy
write path used; the structured form lives in the JSONL only.

Statelessness has one user-visible cost: when an assistant turn
contains multiple text blocks interleaved with tool calls, each text
block re-prints ``**Assistant:**``.  In practice this is fine — the
prefix simply reads as a "speaker label" on each block, similar to a
play script.  A future renderer could batch consecutive same-speaker
events; for v1 we accept the small redundancy in exchange for
trivial reconstruction logic.
