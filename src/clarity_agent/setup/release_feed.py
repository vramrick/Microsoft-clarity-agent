"""Release-feed abstraction + version comparison.

The :class:`ReleaseFeed` protocol is the seam that makes the update
flow unit-testable.  Production code uses :class:`GitHubReleaseFeed`,
which talks to the real GitHub Releases API.  Tests substitute a
stub instance — no network, no signing keys, no special build mode
required.

What this module does NOT do: download binaries, verify signatures,
swap a running app's executable.  Those are the Tauri updater
plugin's responsibility on the desktop binary path, and they're
exercised end-to-end via the ``PRETEND_TO_BE_VERSION`` mechanism
documented in :mod:`~clarity_agent.setup.version` — there's no
point mocking them on the Python side because the production code
that matters here lives in Rust.

What this module *does* do, all of which is fully testable:

  * Parse and compare version strings (:func:`is_newer`).
  * Translate "GitHub Releases API JSON" into a typed
    :class:`ReleaseInfo`.
  * Orchestrate "what's my current version, what's the latest, is
    there an update?" (:func:`check_for_update`).

Stdlib-only on purpose so the updater can run before pip has
finished installing third-party deps.

       tuple and is **never** considered newer than anything.  This
       is what keeps the update path quiet on dev / source builds.
    2. Numeric tuples compare lexicographically; missing trailing
       components are treated as ``0`` (``v1.2`` == ``v1.2.0``).
    3. When the numeric portions are equal, a release with **no
       suffix** beats one with a pre-release suffix (``v1.2.3`` >
       ``v1.2.3-rc1``).  This matches PEP 440 / semver convention.
    4. When both have suffixes and numerics tie, lexicographic
       suffix comparison breaks the tie — coarse but adequate for
       Clarity's ``-rc<N>`` / ``-beta<N>`` style.  We don't
       implement full PEP 440 pre-release ordering because it's
       overkill for the conventions we'll actually use.
