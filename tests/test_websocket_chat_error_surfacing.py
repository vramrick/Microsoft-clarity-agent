"""Tests for the ``/ws/chat`` error-surfacing paths.

Regression coverage for issue #47: when backend construction or a
chat turn fails with an actionable error (missing ``gh`` CLI, bad
API key, network blip), the WebSocket must send a classified
``error_event`` to the frontend before closing.  Previously these
errors propagated silently — uvicorn logged them to stderr and the
socket closed with no message, so the FE just reconnected in a loop
and the user saw "thinking" dots indefinitely.

We assert two paths:

1. ``session.start()`` failure (eager backend construction) →
   error_event + socket stays open to drain follow-up messages.
2. ``session.chat()`` failure (per-turn) → error_event sent + the
   outer loop continues so the user can retry without reconnecting.
