"""Tests for the framework-enforced smoke check.

The smoke check is a judge call that runs after every conversation
(fresh or resumed) and before any test-authored assertion.  It asks
"did the conversation actually exercise the persona's stated goal?"
A negative answer raises :class:`SmokeCheckFailedError` from the
fixture, which the conftest routes to a dedicated ``smoke_failed``
outcome bucket — every test in the module reports as smoke_failed
rather than running against a bad sample.

Surfaces under test:

- :class:`SmokeCheckFailedError` — stores the judge's reasoning so
  the summary can surface it.
- :func:`_goal_pursued_claim_for` — framework-standard claim text; includes
  the goal so changes to the goal invalidate cached smoke records.
- :meth:`Judge.goal_pursued_check` — YES/NO/NA handling, cache behavior, and
  the deliberate choice NOT to route smoke results through the main
  recorder (they belong in a distinct part of the summary).
- :func:`evals.framework.report` — 🛑 icon mapping, smoke_failed
  counting in the top summary and module aggregate, the per-module
  "Goal-pursued check failed" banner with the judge's reasoning.
