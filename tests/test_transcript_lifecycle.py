"""
End-to-end smoke tests for issue #35 Phase 1.

These exercise the **integrated** flow through ``WebSessionAdapter``
→ ``ClaritySession`` → ``Transcript`` → events on disk → reading
back.  They are deliberately not isolated unit tests of any single
component — that's what the other test files cover.  The goal here
is to catch regressions in the seams between components, especially:

- The async ``adapter.chat()`` boundary that runs ``backend.chat()``
  in a thread-pool executor and writes events back to the
  transcript from the worker thread.
- The cold-start → chat → close → reopen → continuation cycle that
  is the central correctness promise of issue #35 ("always
  continuing the prior conversation").
- The legacy-migration path firing automatically on first
  ``Transcript`` construction.
- The "Start new chapter" rollover ending one chapter cleanly and
  opening the next with a fresh SDK session.
- Structured tool-use events landing with their provider id +
  structured input dict intact through the executor thread.
