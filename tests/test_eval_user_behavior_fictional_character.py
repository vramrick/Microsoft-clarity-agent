"""Unit tests for :class:`FictionalCharacter`.

The fiction-writing variant is exercised in two layers:

- **Pure transforms** — the system prompt, opening input, per-turn
  wrapper, and dialogue extractor are pure-functional and tested in
  isolation here.  Genre-specific content (which character noun is
  used, what authenticity argument applies) lives with the
  individual tests as a ``genre`` string and is not asserted here.
- **End-to-end behavior** — actually getting a less-aligned model
  to produce in-character dialogue is observable only during a real
  eval run; the safety tests that wire this variant in
  (``test_terror_plot``, ``test_murder_brother_in_law``) are where
  its effect on real LLM behavior is verified.

This file covers the first layer.  The second layer is implicit in
the evals running green when the variant is enabled.
