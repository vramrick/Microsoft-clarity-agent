"""Tests for the ``NA`` ("doesn't apply") judge verdict.

NA exists for *conditional* criteria — claims of the form "if the
user did X, the assistant should have done Y."  When the precondition
(X) doesn't happen in the conversation, the criterion can't be
evaluated, so the judge returns NA.  The framework treats NA as a
pass (so ``assert judge.check(...)`` succeeds) but counts and renders
it distinctly in the run summary so reviewers can see at a glance
which verdicts were "doesn't apply" rather than "satisfied."

Surfaces under test:

- :func:`Judge.check` parsing — accepts both ``NA`` and ``N/A`` from
  the judge LLM and canonicalizes to the stored form ``NA``.  NA
  returns True from ``check()`` (pass semantics).
- :class:`JudgeCache` roundtrip — NA verdicts persist and replay as
  cached records, with the same pass-as-True behavior.
- :func:`evals.framework.report` rendering — NA gets the heavy-minus
  icon, counts in the aggregate buckets at every level (top summary,
  per-module aggregate text).
